# Kitsune Rush

# Overview

Tools: Unity | Visual Studio Code

Kitsune Rush is a 2D side-scrolling shooter platformer game where players engage in combat against waves of enemies while progressing forward. Developed using Unity, it offers couch co-op functionality, allowing multiple players to join using controllers or keyboards. Drawing inspiration from Cyberpunk 2077, Kitsune Rush pits players against a nefarious corporation, culminating in a showdown with a boss at each level's end. The game comprises three distinct levels, concluding with players facing off against each other. Central to its design is the balance between supporting fellow players and engaging in competitive battles at the conclusion of each stage, ensuring a dynamic and strategic gameplay experience.
